<h2>Tech Stack</h2><br/>
Client: React(Vite, Context API), CSS modules

Server: Node, Express, MongoDB

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

I improved my React working skills, working on forms, validation, Routes, good state managment using hooks, Context API, lazy components loading, working with CSS modules, libraries (react-leaflet). The real challenge was configuring the API and database in MongoDB. Based on what I have created it will be easier to deploy to future projects.
